We are using "npm install react-icons" to get some free icons, check: https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/

"container" folder is not docker containers. In react we divide components into containers and presentational components.
This is to divide View and Logic components.

Container: Maintains state and data logic.
Presentational: Focus on UI rendering logic. Receives data and callbacks from container components.
-> This pattern was more common before React Hooks.
